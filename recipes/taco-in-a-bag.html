      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        I love these walking taco bags, and my family loves them too! I had this
        recipe at the Covered Bridge Festival in Indiana. The chip bag serves as
        a shell for the tacos.

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cook and stir ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until
          browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain excess oil. Mix in water
          and taco seasoning. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer
          for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gently crush corn chips in the sealed bags. Snip one top and one
          bottom corner off each bag, then cut open along the side edge. Spoon
          equal amounts of beef, lettuce, Cheddar, tomato, sour cream, and salsa
          into each bag on top of crushed chips. Serve in the bag and eat using
          a fork.
